# Creating Issues

## Title

Clear, concise, and specific — summarizes the issue or desired outcome.

- Bad: "Map bug"
- Good: "Game crashes when opening the inventory on level 3"

## Body

Structure using these Markdown headings: `## Problem`, `## Goals`, `## Action Items`.

- **Problem:** Current situation, context, or reason for the request. For bugs: steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior.
- **Goals:** What success looks like or the proposed solution.
- **Action Items:** Smaller, actionable steps. Keep top-level (no sub-lists).

Include technical details when relevant (specific files, functions, technologies). Use `path/to/file` format — do NOT prefix with `@`.

## Formatting

- Markdown headings for sections (`## Problem`, etc.)
- Task lists under Action Items (`- [ ] Do the thing`)
- Reference other issues/PRs with `#number` syntax
